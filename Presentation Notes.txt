     Is JavaScript a high-level language or the Assembly Language of the Web? It's initially not clear
that JavaScript is good assembly language as it's a high-level programming language that is itself	 
interpreted, then just-in-time compiled, then turned into machine instructions.

	Assemblers are architecture and processor specific. 

Wikipedia definition - An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other 
programmable device, in which there is a very strong correspondence between the language and the architecture's
machine code instruction.

JavaScript is so ubiquitous, all over the place, that it make sense to use it as a target for compilers of other
languages so that web apps can be written using them
	 
JavaScript remains a popular transpilation/compilation target. From Google's GWT to Clojure to TypeScript to CoffeScript, it all stops at JavaScript because JavaScipt is the ubiquitous
virtual machine hat we already have installed on our machines.

transcompiler, a source-to-source compiler, or transpiler is a type of compiler that takes source code of a programming language as it's input and outputs the source
code into another programming language.

Googlw Web Toolkit is an open source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain complex
JavaScript front-end apps in Java.

Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java VM(and the CLR, and JavaScript)

CoffeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript

TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript and adds static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language

There's only one language that works everywhere without installation or trouble and that's JavaScript.
	 
Every processor has it's own assembler and they are very specific, but the browser's javaScript VM is what runs the "new machine code".
There's only one processor architecture. It's the Web!	 
	 
A JavaScript engine is a virtual machine which interprets and executes JavaScript.

Mozilla asm.js - a strict subset of JavaScript that can be used as a low-level, efficient target language for compilers. This
sub language effectively describes a sand-boxed virtual machine for memory-unsafe languages like C or C++. A combination of static and dynamic validation allows 
JavaScript engines to employ an ahead-of-time optimizing compilation strategy for valid asm.js code

OdinMonkey, a JavaScript engine that recognizes when it has been fed an asm.js program and can apply automatic optimizations
	 
A sandbox is a tightly controlled environment where programs can be run. They restrict what a piece of code can do, giving it just as many permissions
as it needs without adding additional permissions that could be abused


CoffeScript - a little language that compiles into JavaScript. CoffeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavScript in a simple way.	 
	 
Compilers like Emscripten or Mandreel compile C++ to JavaScript	 


	 
Native Client is a sandbox for running compiled C and C++ in the browser efficiently and securely, independent of the user's operating system 
sandboxing technology for running a subset of Intel x86, ARM or MIPS native code in a sandbox, allowing web-based apps to run at near
native speeds
	 
Enscripten is a type of compiler termed a source-to-source compiler or transcompiler. as it's input it takes LLVM bytecode, typically created
by compiling from C or C++. As output oi emits a file in the JavaScript programming language 

LLVM - compiler infrastructure designed as a set of reusable libraries with well-defined interfaces. It is written in C++ and is designed for compile-time, link-time,
run-time, and "idle-time' optimization of programs written in arbitrary programming languages	

Portable Native Client - works by compiling native C and C++ code to an intermediate representation, rather than architecture specific representations as in Native Client
It remains to be seen if other JavaScript engines take up asm.js. the alternative are the ones above, but only one browser manufacturer is supporting it.

abc - a language for notating music using the ASXCII character set
ChucK, strongly timed, concurrent , and -the-fly audio programming language
Cmix,Impromptu, a Scheme language environment for Mac

languages optimized for sound production, algorithmic composition, and sound synthesis

	 
A software design document is a written description ofa software product, that a software designer writes in order to give a software development
team overall guidance to the architecture ofthe software project. Usually accompanies an architecture diagram with pointers to detailed feature
specifications of smaller pieces of the design. A design document needs to be a stable reference, outlining all parts of the software and how they work.
The document is commanded to give a fairly complete description, while maintaining a high-level view of the software
